## Overview

This is my first Frontend Mentor challenge. I followed a Web Development course before and learned CSS but I didn't practice or tried making something myself. After the course when I tried making a website for a hackathon I realized I just learned it passively and jumped on next topics like Javascript without actually practicing it. I faced imposter syndrome and tutorial hell. Now I am learning web dev again and learning by doing. Making progress slowly and trying to learn concepts deeply instead of completely as tasks. It was fun to complete the challenge on my own trying to figure out why things are not working, and how to fix them. Web design may not be considered art but it is like an art. It was similar to painting for me I was an artist(programmer) looking at a scenery(design) and trying to replicate it on my artboard(web browser) with my tools(keyboard) and properties(CSS properties). This analogy may sound lame but it made me love CSS more.
 
### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

- I first traced the design images in figma to get better understanding of margin, padding, and font properties used.
- Then I initialized a git repository to track changes.
- Structured the content with HTML5.
- Made card using flexbox.
- Used text properties, margin and padding to match the design with the help of inspect tab in Figma.
- Used CSS reset to make it pixel perfect and adjust defaults.
- Deployed it using github pages.
- Made some changes, pushed it to github and repeated it many times.
- Followed and learned best accessibility best practices.
- Asked some doubts and shared my solution on socials.
