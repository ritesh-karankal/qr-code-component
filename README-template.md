## Overview

This is my first Frontend Mentor challenge. I followed a Web Development course before and learned CSS but I didn't practice or tried making something myself. After the course when I tried making a website for a hackathon I realized I just learned it passively and jumped on next topics like Javascript without actually practicing it. I faced imposter syndrome and tutorial hell. Now I am learning web dev again and learning by doing. Making progress slowly and trying to learn concepts deeply instead of completely as tasks. It was fun to complete the challenge on my own trying to figure out why things are not working, and how to fix them. Web design may not be considered art but it is like an art. It was similar to painting for me I was an artist(programmer) looking at a scenery(design) and trying to replicate it on my artboard(web browser) with my tools(keyboard) and properties(CSS properties). This analogy may sound lame but it made me love CSS more.

## My process

- I first traced the design images in figma to get better understanding of margin, padding, and font properties used.
- Then I initialized a git repository to track changes.
- Structured the content with HTML5.
- Made card using flexbox.
- Used text properties, margin and padding to match the design with the help of inspect tab in Figma.
- Used CSS reset to make it pixel perfect and adjust defaults.
- Deployed it using github pages.
- Made some changes, pushed it to github and repeated it many times.
- Followed and learned best accessibility best practices.
- Asked some doubts and shared my solution on socials.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
<!-- - CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

- Made a pixel perfect design.
- Got little clarity for max-height and min-height.

### Continued development

Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect.

I am still confused about some elements what to use like padding or margin.
Should I adjust text width with padding or width property.
How to use apt tags for texts.
What are the best practices for units.
Try to use appropriate tags.
Follow best accessibility practices.


### Useful resources

- [CSS reset by Josh W Comeau](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/custom-css-reset/) - This helped me for resetting css defaults. I really liked this CSS reset. I was short and easy to understand than other classic resets like Eric Meyer's famous CSS Reset. Will use this in my following challenges.
